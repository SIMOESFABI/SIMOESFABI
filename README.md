😊 Hello World!!

In early 2022 I decided to make a career transition and migrate to the IT area.
I started this journey by signing up for the Academia de Code bootcamp.
In this trajectory, I managed to develop the ability to learn programming languages and important tools to start a career in the IT area.
In addition to developing autonomy in the search for new knowledges.
Personally, I have self-motivation as the main driver of my ambition.
The ability to listen and interpersonal relationships makes me a person involved in teamwork!


🧰 My Main Skills
•	Java and Object-Oriented Programming
•	Java Script 
•	HTML and CSS
• SQL (MySQL)

🐱‍💻 A mixture of perseverance with resilience, and a constant search for my best!
